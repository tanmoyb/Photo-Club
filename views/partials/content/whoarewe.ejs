  <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    <p>We are students of Metropolia University Of Applied Sciences , Have you reached a point where all your photos start to look the same? Feeling uninspired? Or maybe you haven’t gone shooting for a while at all?

It happens to us all now and then, kind of like writer’s block. When we get too comfortable with what we do, we get into a routine and everything starts to look the same. This is why it’s important for artists to break out of our own molds from time to time. Releazing this we planned to create a club for meetups and discussions about our photograps</p>
    <p>Each Featured Artist has an opportunity to speak at one of our meetups and share his or her vision, perspective, and techniques with attendees on a more personal level than at our large conference. It is truly an honor to be a CAC Featured Artist and many past students artists who were featured at CAC have gone on to brilliant careers in art.</p>
